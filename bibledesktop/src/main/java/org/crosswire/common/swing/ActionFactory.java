/**
 * The ActionFactory is being radically updated. Take the following with a grain of salt.
 * 
 * The ActionFactory is responsible for creating CWActions and making them
 * available to the program. Each Action is constructed from resources of the
 * form: ActionName.field=value where ActionName is the ACTION_COMMAND_KEY value
 * and field is one of the CWAction constants, e.g. LargeIcon. <br>
 * Field is one of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Name - This is required. The value is used for the text of the Action.<br>
 * A mnemonic can be specified by preceding the letter with _. Using this letter in
 * a case insensitive search, the earliest position of that letter will
 * cause the it to be underlined. In a platform dependent
 * way it provides a keyboard mechanism to fire the action. For example, on
 * Windows, alt + mnemonic will cause a visible, active element with that
 * mnemonic to fire. For this reason, it is important to ensure that two
 * visible, active elements do not have the same mnemonic.<br>
 * Note: Mnemonics are suppressed on MacOSX.</li>
 * 
 * <li>ToolTip - A tip to show when the mouse is over an element. If not
 * present, Name is used. This is likely to change. It is redundant to show a
 * tooltip that is identical to the shown text.</li>
 * 
 * <li>SmallIcon - A 16x16 pixel image to be shown for the item. The value for
 * this is a path which can be found as a resource.<br>
 * Note: the small icon will be used when actions are tied to menu items and
 * buttons.</li>
 * 
 * <li>LargeIcon - A 24x24 pixel image to be shown for the item when large items
 * are shown. Currently, these are only used for the ToolBar, when a large
 * toolbar is requested. The value is a resource path to the image.</li>
 * 
 * <li>AcceleratorKey - A key on the keyboard, which may be specified with 0x25
 * kind of notation.<br>
 * <br>
 * Accelerators are global key combinations that work within an application to
 * fire the action. When the action is shown as a menu item the accelerator will
 * be listed with the name. Note: The accelerator key and it's modifiers are
 * converted into a <code>KeyStroke</code> with
 * <code>KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(key, modifierMask);</code></li>
 * 
 * <li>AcceleratorKey.Modifier - A comma separated list of ctrl, alt, and shift,
 * indicating what modifiers are necessary for the accelerator.<br>
 * Note: ctrl will use a platform's command key. On MacOSX this is the
 * Apple/Command key. Other platforms use Ctrl.</li>
 * <li>Enabled - Defaults to true when not present. It is disabled when the
 * value does not match "true" regardless of case. This is used to initialize
 * widgets tied to actions to disabled. Once the action is created, it's state
 * can be changed and the tied widgets will behave appropriately.</li>
 * <li>Shared - Defaults to true when not present. It is unshared when the value
 * does not match "true" regardless of case. When false, each copy of the action
 * is independent of other copies.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to facilitate easier translation, Enabled, SmallIcon and LargeIcon
 * can be specified in a parallel resource, whose name is suffixed with
 * "_control" as in Desktop_control. This is meant to extrapolate the constant
 * behavior of an action into a file that probably does not need to be
 * internationalized. If it does, for example, to suppress the display of icons,
 * then one would create a resource further suffixed with the language and
 * perhaps country, as in Desktop_control_fa.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To add another twist, several actions may have the same name and mnemonic,
 * differing perhaps by tooltip. To facilitate the sharing of these definitions,
 * an Aliases resource is defined to contain common values. If the value of a
 * ActionName.Name is prefixed with "Alias.", as in Go.Name=Alias.Go, then Go
 * will be used as the ActionName to look up values in the Aliases resource.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Aliases defines defaults that can be overridden by the referring resource
 * file. The only value that cannot be overridden is Name.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When an action is fired, this class, as a listener, reflects the action on
 * the class providing the resource. For example, DesktopActions creates an
 * ActionFactory from the Desktop ResourceBundle. When the Exit action is fired,
 * ActionFactory calls DesktopActions.doExit(ActionEvent event) or
 * DesktopActions.doExit(), if the first did not exist.
 * </p>

 * @see gnu.gpl.License The GNU General Public License for details.
